<div class="Networking">
     <h3>NetWorking</h3>
    <p>Networking is a key point when working with Computers. 
        Computer Software Development has numerous opportunites in the industry.
        An old saying goes "Its not so much what you know, but Who you know."
        It may seem cliche, but Networking is very key when you know people, 
        they can help guide you to what you need to do next for a job.
        Earning a Masters degree in Business Marketing and Management, is one of my hightlight,
    </p>
<div class="College Class">
    <h4>College Classes</h4>
    <p>Does this sound familiar? Well what do you know, It is August 28, 2023 and 
        I am in my 1st year at IHCC, taking on CSD. Computer Software Development is 
        one of those careers that takes patience, time and positivity. I am taking Python,
        with "Susan Wilson" and she is the nicest teacher you could ever ask for.
        In addition, I am studying Beginning Webpage Development, and who better else,
        to have as an instructor, "James Warner". I am learning so much about programming,
        coding, HTML, and CSS and all sorts of fun projects and lab units.
