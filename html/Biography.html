    <h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>
    <p>When I was young, I was a rambunctious child and you wouldn't believe it, but
        I was always into the sugar bowl, haha. Sports was a huge part of my life growing up,
        at the age of 5 I played soccer, and rode my bikes and I loved running. When growing up
        I attended Eisenhower Elementary school, where I had the best of friends. My favorite part of school,
        was outside reces, gym class and lunch.
