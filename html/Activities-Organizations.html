        <h3 id="Aurhor">Written by Alexander Meiners – June 4th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Rollerblading has been a huge passion of mine and I have seen musicals and dances, but no Rollerblading dance offs.
            I began thinking about writing a book about rollerblading dance and that All ages can read.
            One of my favorite parts of writing is the style and creativity behind the book story.</p>
        <p>The unique part of writing a book is that you get to start from scratch and build.
            Rollerblading is a great outdoor activity, but does possess risks if your not careful.
            I taught myself how to rollerblade and ever since then I have fall in love with skating in my free time.
            Writing a story was never something I even dreamed of, but it has been a hightlight throughout my life.
